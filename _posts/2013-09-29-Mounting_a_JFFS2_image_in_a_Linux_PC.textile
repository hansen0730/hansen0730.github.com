We often use JFFS2 binary images for embedded system, generating them with mkfs.jffs2.

In some instances, it could also be good to mount a jffs2 image into your PC to modify it directly.

To do that,  type the following commands as root in a linux shell:
modprobe mtdcore
modprobe jffs2
modprobe mtdram
modprobe mtdchar
modprobe mtdblock
dd if=image-jffs2 of=/dev/mtd0
mount /dev/mtdblock0 mnt

If your image is larger than the default kernel size (4MB in my case), you can try to adjust the mtdram device size with the total_size parameters. when inserting the mtdram module, e.g.:
modprobe mtdram total_size=8096 
where total_size is expressed in KB
